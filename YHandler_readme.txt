YHandler
Yahoo Fantasy Sports OAuth And Request Handler

This is the Python Script I use to access the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API via OAuth for my desktop app. It's far from polished, and not the most generalized. However, following these steps should work:

Place your consumer key, and consumer secret in the auth.csv file
call: from YHandler import *
create a handler with: var_name = YHandler('auth.csv')
The app needs the following libraries, which you can install using pip:
